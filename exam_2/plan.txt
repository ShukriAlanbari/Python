Define the Classes and Attributes:

Create the User class with attributes: ID, full name, address, mobile number, email address, password, and a path to the CSV file for the user database.
Create the Customer class with attributes: ID, company name, company address, reference person's full name, reference person's mobile number, reference person's email address, company invoices email address, and a list of related user IDs.
Create the Item class with attributes: price per kg, volume, weight, and type.
Create the Vehicle class with attributes: type (Bike, Truck, or Ship), maximum item capacity, and maximum weight capacity.
User Registration:

Implement a user registration system that allows users to create an account. Ensure that the password meets the specified criteria.
Store user data in the CSV file specified in the User class.
Customer Registration:

Implement a customer registration system for corporate customers. This should allow them to provide company-related information and associate related users.
Store customer data in the CSV file specified in the Customer class.
Order Creation:

Create a class to represent an order. An order should include a list of items, the customer who placed the order, and the destination.
Item Management:

Implement item management functionalities to add, remove, or modify items. Each item should have price per kg, volume, weight, and type (fragile, solid).
Order Placement:

Implement a system that allows registered users (both individual and corporate) to place orders. Users should select items and specify the destination.
Calculate the cost of the order based on the cost of each item.
Order Tracking:

Create a feature that allows users to track their orders. Users should be able to check the status and location of their orders.
Vehicle Management:

Implement vehicle management functionalities for bikes, trucks, and ships. Ensure that each type of vehicle can carry the specified maximum number of items and weight.
Order Shipping:

Develop a process to ship orders using the appropriate vehicles (bikes, trucks, or ships) based on the order's characteristics (size, weight).
Update the status of orders during shipping.
Customer Billing:

Implement a billing system for customers. Charge customers for delivering their items based on the cost of the order.
Data Storage and Retrieval:

Create functions to read and write data to the CSV files associated with users and customers. This ensures that user and customer data is persistent.
User Interface (Optional):

Create a simple user interface, such as a command-line interface, to interact with the system. This allows users to register, place orders, and track orders more easily.
Testing:

Thoroughly test the system to ensure that it works as expected, including user registration, order placement, order tracking, and billing.
Documentation:

Document the code and create user guides or manuals to help users and administrators understand how to use the system.
Deployment (Optional):

If needed, deploy the system on a server to make it accessible to users over the internet.
Maintenance and Updates:

Plan for ongoing maintenance and updates to the system based on user feedback and changing requirements.
This step-by-step plan outlines the development process for the logistics system with the basic functionality you described. You can break down each step into smaller tasks and begin implementing the system.
