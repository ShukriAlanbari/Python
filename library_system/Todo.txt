  ============================================================================


Todo in groups:  
1- In a group: write down your plan that answers the
   questions A-D and present it – 60 min. 

2- Create the classes as back-end – 4 hours. 

3- Build the front-end for this project - 8 hours. 

4- Present your solution to the classroom. 



To be able to start with this system we need to think about: 

A. What are the main classes? What is the best integration between them. taking in 
consideration future integration with school system that has already employees and student 
in their management system.

B. As we don’t have access yet to permanent database and files, which python data type is the 
best to save info about teachers, students, Literature books, Science books, Entertainment 
books to manage borrow and return operations. 

C. What are the methods and attributes we need to be able to manage all operations /methods 
requested? 

D. Where should we start? Books classes, student class or teacher class or general borrower 
class?



Approach:

Classes:
    Masterclass = Borrower():
    Contains info about the specific borrower.
    Will be divided into two subclasses:
    Attr.:
        Name
        Phone Number
        Age
        ID (Will identify Teacher or Student)

            Subclass = Teacher(Borrower):
            Subclass = Student(Borrower):

    Masterclass = Book():
    Will be divided into three subclasses, one for
    each booktype:
    Attr.:
        StudentPrice
        TeacherPrice
        Fine            (<-- Not returned on time)
                        (If 3 times not returned on time
                        will mean person not allowed to
                        borrow again)
        BorrowWeeksMax
        Title = ""

            Subclass = LiteratureBook(Book):
                self.StudentPrice = 0
                self.TeacherPrice = 10
                self.BorrowTimeMax = 4

            Subclass = ScienceBook(Book):
                self.StudentPrice = 5
                self.TeacherPrice = 15
                self.BorrowTimeMax = 4 & 2 
                (One for Student, One for Teacher)

            Subclass = EntertainmentBook(Book):
                self.StudentPrice = 0
                self.TeacherPrice = 0
                self.BorrowTimeMax = 3

    LibSys():
    Will manage payments,
    borrowing info (who borrowed,
    what price and how long)
    along with general management.
